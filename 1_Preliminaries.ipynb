    "\n",
    "PyTorch has its own [data loader](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader). But text data requires pre-processing, vocabulary, the way how to recognize starting and ending tokens in a sentence, etc. All this is implemented in the function `get_loader` in file [data_loader.py](data_loader.py). It loads the COCO dataset in batches and pre-processes the captions and transforms the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_loader` function takes as input a number of arguments that can be explored in **data_loader.py**. Most of the arguments can be left at their default values apart from the ones below:\n",
    "1. **`transform`** - an [image transform](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html) specifying how to pre-process the images and convert them to PyTorch tensors before using them as input to the CNN encoder.\n",
    "2. **`mode`** - one of `'train'` (loads the training data in batches) or `'test'` (for the test data).\n",
    "3. **`batch_size`** - determines the batch size.  When training the model, this is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step.\n",
    "4. **`vocab_threshold`** - the total number of times that a word must appear in the training captions before it is used as part of the vocabulary.  Words that have fewer than `vocab_threshold` occurrences in the training captions are considered unknown words. \n",
    "5. **`vocab_from_file`** - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from a file."

This is true for all `Dataset` classes in PyTorch; if this is unfamiliar to you, please review [the tutorial linked above](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html). \n",

    "\n",
    "Image pre-processing is relatively straightforward (from the `__getitem__` method in the `CoCoDataset` class):\n",

    "# Convert image to tensor and pre-process using transform\n",

    "image = self.transform(image)\n",
    "```\n",
    "After loading the image in the training folder with the name `path`, the image is pre-processed using the same transform (`transform_train`) that was supplied when instantiating the data loader.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caption Pre-Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "The captions also need to be pre-processed and prepped for training. The goal is to create a model that predicts the next token of a sentence from previous tokens. Thus, every caption associated with an image is transformed into a list of tokenized words, before casting it to a PyTorch tensor that is used to train the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand in more detail how COCO captions are pre-processed, first take a look at the `vocab` instance variable of the `CoCoDataset` class.  The code snippet below is pulled from the `__init__` method of the `CoCoDataset` class:\n",

    "def __init__(self, transform, mode, batch_size, vocab_threshold, vocab_file, start_word, \n",
